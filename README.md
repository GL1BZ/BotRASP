# BOTRASP WITH API


The project itself consists of three parts, including: APP, Telegram Bot and Website

API - responds to user GET requests in which they can get information about the schedule for the selected date in the form of an image or JSON response

Telegram Bot - includes all the necessary functionality. Such as displaying a schedule for any dates and notifications about a new schedule every day

The website is a business card for Telegram Bot and documentation on working with the API. It also has functionality for user feedback to improve the quality of the API and Telegram Bot
